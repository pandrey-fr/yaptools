# Yet Another Python Toolbox (YAPTools)

YAPTools is a Python package grouping utilitarian functions and classes
which I commonly use in various Python projects. As any toolbox conceived
by any programmer, it may provide with useful tools for some people, and
yet seem utterly useless to others. I mainly publish this toolbox as a
dependency for other open-source projects which I hope may be useful to other
people.
